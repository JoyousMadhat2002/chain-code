# GroupSixChainCode MATLAB App

## Overview
`GroupSixChainCode` is a MATLAB GUI application 
for shape analysis using Freeman Chain Code, 
Differential Chain Code, and Normalized Chain Code. 
It allows users to process two images, extract boundary features, 
and compare shapes based on chain code similarity.

## Features

- Load and display two images for side-by-side comparison
- Apply edge detection (Canny) and thinning to extract object boundaries
- Generate Freeman Chain Code using 8-directional boundary traversal
- Compute Differential Chain Code using the formula:
  
  dₖ = (cₖ - cₖ₋₁) mod 8

- Normalize chain codes through circular shifts for rotation invariance
- Compare normalized chain codes and output similarity as a percentage
- Save extracted chain codes and edge data to a file

## Direction Encoding (8-direction Freeman Chain Code)

| Code | Direction   | Δx | Δy |
|------|-------------|----|----|
| 0    | East        | +1 |  0 |
| 1    | Northeast   | +1 | -1 |
| 2    | North       |  0 | -1 |
| 3    | Northwest   | -1 | -1 |
| 4    | West        | -1 |  0 |
| 5    | Southwest   | -1 | +1 |
| 6    | South       |  0 | +1 |
| 7    | Southeast   | +1 | +1 |

## GUI Workflow

1. Load the first and second images using the respective buttons.
2. Click "Extract Features" to apply edge detection and thinning.
3. Use "Extract Chain Code" to generate and display the chain code data.
4. Use "Compare the Two" to compute similarity between the two shapes.
5. Optionally, save results to a file using the "Save Chain Code" buttons.

## Getting Started

1. Open `GroupSixChainCode_exported.m` or `GroupSixChainCode.mlapp`(to be able to edit the app) in MATLAB.
2. Click "Run" to launch the app.
3. Follow the GUI workflow to analyze and compare shapes.
